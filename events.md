# New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data

The Text as Data Association holds an annual “New Directions in Analyzing Text as Data” conference (TADA),
which is
a leading forum for research on the study of politics, society, and culture through computational analysis of documents. Recent advances in NLP have the potential to revolutionize how we study human society. But using these tools effectively, reliably, and equitably requires continuous dialog between experts across computational methods, social science, and the humanities.


The next edition of this conference will take place on
October 6-7, 2022 at Cornell Tech, Roosevelt Island, New York City.  See the conference website <a href="https://tada2022.org/">tada2022.org</a>.
